## zmk notes

.keymap and .conf must match the shield name (i.e. kyria_rev2)
Use the extension names  build.yaml, config/west.yml and .github/workflows/build.yml

In .keymap: 
can't use lower case
can't use only number. need N1, N2

how i got the default shield:
download: https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/tree/main/app/boards/shields/boardsource5x12
into ./boards/shields/hamboarder
using https://download-directory.github.io/




## todo

put the pink switches on the &mo keys 

add arrow keys to ergogen
add central space to ergogen
route traces

make a cutout for the battery in the pcb and it reduces the stiffness
0.5mm steel key retention plate
2.5mm aluminium stiffness plate with diodes underneath extending, into the hand area. only a cutout for the battery
1mm squashed eva foam and 0.5mm carbon fibre bash guard. 
for the 9.2mm from alu plate to key top level, use hand cut cork filler and a plywood top? fill the wristh guard area with cork
5mm plywood boundary plate 340x165 to go on top of the steel plate and guard the boudary
just 1cm thick cork squares hand cut and glued for the wrist rests. 

0.5 


get cover cut: 
quotes: https://www.printeurope.fr/en-gb/demande-de-devis, 

1mm eva foam filler layer: pcb=1.6mm, switch leg=3mm, protrusion = 1.4mm. 
kapton sheet ? 

~~add hotswap connections
~~move diodes between switches
~~convert ergogen to default pinout
~~build 5x12 firmare on actions.
~~add a 6th row in the shield
~~convert the 5x12 template to my name format and try to run
